# JetsProject
Description

This program creates a fleet of jets with different capabilities and allows users to access information about the jets and use them. The jets have a model, speed, range, and price associated with them. The program also allows users to add and remove jets from the fleet.

The main class, JetsApplication, launches the program and provides a menu for user interaction. The AirField class stores the collection of jets, which can be read from a text file on program startup. The jets can be of different types, with the Jet class being the abstract base class for implementations. The program allows users to view the fleet of jets, fly all jets, view the fastest jet, view the jet with the longest range, and perform actions specific to the implemented interfaces, such as loading cargo or engaging in combat.
